Some tests give an empty in, some give an empty file, and one I saw just printed the type of NullItem.
This is pretty confusing.
It probably has something to do with the parser.
But it could also have something to do with the multilevel inheretance shenanigans.
And all the casting stuff we do in liveness.cpp.
Gotta double check the main algorithm as well.
And hopefully optimize it a bit later.
